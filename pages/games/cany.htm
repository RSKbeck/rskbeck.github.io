    Canyons is a first-person RPG that generates canyons and enemies as the player progresses. The player fights through waves of enemies in an attempt to defeat the boss before night falls and the enemies become too difficult to defeat. This was the final project for an Interactive Entertainment Engineering class and the game was made with Unity.</p>

  <p>The player can hold one sword, one bow, and one spell, which can each be swapped out. The player starts the game with a shield and a single weapon and can earn better equipment as the game progresses through random drops earned by defeating enemies.

  <p>I was responsible for implementing most of the player's weapons and abilities, aside from moving around, which simply used Unity's character controller. This includes the ability to pick up and swap weapons from the inventory which holds one weapon of each kind, sword and shield, bow, and spell.</p>

I implemented the player's ability to attack with the sword and fire the bow and spells, using free models for the weapons and particles for the spells. My biggest challenge in doing this was synchronizing everything with the animations for the player's arms, which I modeled, rigged, and animated. The animations had to play at different speeds depending on the weapon's stats, they each had to trigger different events, and they had to smoothly transition between one another.</p>

  <p>I used public domain sounds for all of the weapon and walking sounds, and I wrote all of the game's music in Ableton Live.</p>
