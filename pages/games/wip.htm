    I'm currently working on a capture the flag game. The game takes place between two teams of three and players can be human or AI. My hope is to make it an online multiplayer game. The game will have different stages, weapons, and power-ups to make each game interesting. There will be multiple play modes, like winning based on the highest score or the first team to reach a score.</p>
