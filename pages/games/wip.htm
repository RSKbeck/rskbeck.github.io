    I'm currently working independently on a rogue-like game where the player must cooperate with a team of other players or NPCs to complete objectives, which will vary level to level. Each level will feature an objective like "Find the treasure" or "Defeat the traitor on your team", a set of rules, and a procedurally generated map. The game will also feature multiple character classes, which will affect the behavior of the NPCs. The game is being developed in C++ using SFML.</p>
